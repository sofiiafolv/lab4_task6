Welcome to this game!!!
Today you can travel through the 5 streets of Lviv.
Little spoiler: in the end you will meet the boss, and if you beat him, you will win the game.
You will also meet different characters on the streets of Lviv.Some of them can be your friends,
and others are enemies. You can talk with them. Their names are transliterated from Ukrainian.
Friends have some items, and you can get them if you give something in return.
You need to defeat the enemy to also get some things you need.
You can also find something on the streets.
Your health is 30. I hope itâ€™s enough. You also have a backpack where you can find items, which
you collect.
I think you will understand further during the game.
Be careful and good luck !!!
